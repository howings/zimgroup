Zim.js group project. 

Project Information: 
This is a desktop/mobile version of an interactive game with main features as animating along with squiggles and hit tests. There are mainly 3 types of characters: pests and beneficial insects and the tree. While both of the pests and insects are all living on the tree as our stage, the numbers of each type of bug have to be controlled so that the tree will not be destroyed.

Main User: Any ages but primarily with kids in mind.

Winning Goal:
Kill all the pests within a time limit so the tree can be preserved.
Balance the number of pests and insects so the tree will not be damaged.
